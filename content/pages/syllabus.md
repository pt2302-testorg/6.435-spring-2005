Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Required Textbook
-----------------

Ljung, Lennart. _System Identification: A Theory for the User_. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1998. ISBN: 0136566952.

Prerequisites
-------------

[6.241](/courses/6-241j-dynamic-systems-and-control-spring-2011) and [6.432](/courses/6-432-stochastic-processes-detection-and-estimation-spring-2004).

Grading Policy
--------------

Grades in this course will be based on Homework. We will have approximately 6 sets, a set every 2 weeks. The final 2 sets will be project-like. **Any** use of written solutions from previous terms is **not** permitted. If you have access to such solutions, keep them out of reach! Violations will be dealt with severely.

Collaborations with other students are permitted on the first 4 homework sets, as long as you work out the homework by yourself. For the last two sets, we will have a separate policy. Discussions with the TA about the homework are permitted and encouraged.
